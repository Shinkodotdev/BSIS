                    The poblacion of Talavera was originally one large central community stretching from Calipahan in the north to La Torre in the south. 
                    In 1972, it was subdivided into eight barangays to better manage population and governance, including Poblacion Sur, locally called “Dulong Bayan” or “may Kamposanto.”

                    Some of the earliest families include Alejandro, Aquino, Cipriano, dela Cruz, Manabat, Mendez, Mendoza, Santos, Sebastian, Puselero, Valencia, and Villacorte clans. Their contributions helped shape the community from farming and trade to local leadership.
